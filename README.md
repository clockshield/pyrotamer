# Web App
-Currently our web application is able to place data points onto the map and record it in the database. By utilizing mapbox API as well as mongo DB, we created functions to input the latitude and longitude coordinates of our application. We connected the mapbox API and mongoDB through the use of ExpressJS, helping us create our own packaging code to send to the database. -We currently plan to clean the UI as well as fix any bugs that we find in our program.


# Mobile App
-Similar to what the web app but the features are not very tedious to use.
-Plan to add a remove feature, connect with MonboDB, and change UI to a user friendly UI.
